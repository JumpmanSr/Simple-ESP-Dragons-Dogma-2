Features:
- Added Toggles for Each ESP in Settings!
- Added Max Distance setting (same value for all ESPs)
- Friendly ESP
- Enemy ESP
  - Shows HP
  - Shows Distance
- Chest ESP
  - With distance
- All Interactable ESP (DEV)
  - Ability to find Seeker's Tokens only (distance not supported atm)
  - I don't intend to fully support this but it's available, a bit glitchy but it works. 
- Customizeable Font Size, Colors, and Text Offsets
- Almost Entirely using LUA + REFramework, should be good to go as long as REFramework is up-to-date
  - Some Minor Dependencies on LUA and other Scripting Tools.
- Hotkeys for KB/M and Controller ("1" on PC, R-Trigger+Left on DPas for Controller)

Known Issues:
- No Offscreen checks (sorry but kinda not needed either ya know)
- Code could be a lot better --sorry first time lua :)
