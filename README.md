Features:
- Friendly ESP

  - Shows Distance
- Customizeable Font Size, Colors, and Text Offsets
- Almost Entirely using LUA + REFramework, should be good to go as long as REFramework is up-to-date
  - Some Minor Dependencies on LUA and other Scripting Tools.
- Hotkeys for KB/M and Controller ("1" on PC, R-Trigger+Left on DPas for Controller)

Known Issues:
- Pawns will show up as ???? (May fix later)
- No Max Draw Distance (Future Update)
- No Offscreen checks (sorry but kinda not needed either ya know)
- Dead Mobs/Friendlys stay
- Code could be a lot better --sorry first time lua :) 


TON OF CREDITS TO THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR OF "NAME ON HEAD" He inspired this and I was able to use and learn from a lot of his code, so without him none of this would even be possible, please make sure you check out his github!!
